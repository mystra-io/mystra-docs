# 1.2 Main objectives

## Who is Mystra intended for?

The Mystra platform is directed at two target groups:

## For individual users (Community)

Mystra provides the community with access to a diverse range of tools available within the blockchain ecosystem. Users can utilize the Fiat Payment Gateway for cryptocurrency purchases. On our Dex, you can exchange for other cryptocurrencies through swaps and enhance liquidity by participating in Liquidity Pools. The Bridge tool allows the seamless transfer of assets between different networks. Staking tools enable users to directly delegate their tokens to validators and receive rewards in the form of token-based commissions. The NFT Marketplace facilitates free trading of digital artworks, and NFT farming will also be available on the platform. Additionally, Mystra offers a Chat tool to facilitate communication among users.

Users who meet the requirements for owning a Mystra NFT Ticket and participate in validator staking can use the DAO module to partake in the decision-making process through voting regarding the development direction of projects incubating on the Mystra platform. They also have the opportunity to invest in these projects at an early stage through Decentralized Venture Capital and participate in investments aligned with the project launch process on our Launchpad.

Mystra's platform operates on a social points system, where users are rewarded with points in exchange for specific actions or participation. The number of points accumulated by users is associated with their account and impacts their voting power within the DAO and allocation in relation to incubated projects. For more details on this, please refer to section 3: Points System.

In summary, Mystra is a social platform with a point-based incentive system that offers everyday tools and early-stage investment opportunities in projects. For more detailed information, please follow the provided links.

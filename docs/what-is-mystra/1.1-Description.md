# 1.1 Description

## What is Mystra?

Mystra unites communities from new, yet untapped blockchain networks by providing essential tools for both users and creators on one convenient platform. This allows every user to communicate, integrate with others, establish new connections, and have an impact on both the platform's future and the projects incubated within it. Creators can develop projects using the tools and APIs provided by Mystra, while also having access to the community centered around the Mystra platform. It aims to connect users with both new L1 networks and established blockchain networks. This functionality makes it easy for experienced users to interact with new networks, facilitating the development and utilization of various blockchain ecosystems.

# 7.2 How to stake?

### Mystra validator on Casper Network

To delegate CSPR to <a href="https://cspr.live/validator/020377bc3ad54b5505971e001044ea822a3f6f307f8dc93fa45a05b7463c0a053bed">Mystra validator on Casper Network</a> you will need to have a <a href="https://www.casperwallet.io/download">Casper Wallet</a> or <a href="https://www.ledger.com/">Ledger hardware wallet</a>.


After downloading the wallet, follow these <a href="https://www.casperwallet.io/user-guide/delegating-and-undelegating-cspr">instructions</a> to stake your CSPR, or the <a href="https://docs.casperlabs.io/workflow/ledger-setup/">tutorial</a>  that explains how to start delegating with Ledger.

#### Important!
The staked coins are never physically transferred to the validator. Control of the coins always belongs to the delegator (to you). Even if the validator becomes inactive, you will still be able to undelegate your CSPR.

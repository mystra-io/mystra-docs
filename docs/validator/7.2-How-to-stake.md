# 7.2 How to stake?

To delegate CSPR on our validator you will need to have a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/casper-signer/djhndpllfiibmcdbnmaaahkhchcoijce/">Casper Signer</a> or <a href="https://www.ledger.com/">Ledger hardware wallet</a>.

If you don't have it, please read our <a href="https://medium.com/@CasperArmy/how-to-stake-casper-cspr-using-the-casper-signer-chrome-extension-79d7808f31c4">tutorial</a> on how to set up a Casper Signer wallet to delegate your CSPR, or the <a href="https://docs.casperlabs.io/workflow/ledger-setup/">tutorial</a>  that explains how to start delegating with Ledger.

#### Remember
The staked coins are never physically transferred to the validator. Control of the coins always belongs to the delegator (to you). Even if the validator becomes inactive, you will still be able to undelegate your CSPR.

# 7.6 FAQ

## 1. How long after I start staking will I receive my first rewards?
A: After delegating your CSPR to the validator, the first rewards will be paid after about 4-6 hours.

## 2. How long does unstaking take?
A: CSPR unstaking/undelegating takes 7-8 eras which is 14-16 hours.

## 3. How often do I get rewards?
A: Rewards are paid every 2 hours.

## 4. Can I delegate CSPR to more than one validator?
A: Yes. You can make multiple delegations of your funds to more than one validator, or you can delegate all your funds to one.

## 5. What would happen if the validator stop operating? 
A: If the validator was inactive or failed, your funds are still under your control, and it is possible to undelegate your CSPR.

## 6. What percentage of fees does the CasperArmy validator charge?
A: For example, if you stake 10,000 CSPR at an APY of 10%, you receive 1,000 CSPR per annum of which the indicated fee of 4% is 40 CSPR, meaning that your remuneration is 960 CSPR per annum.

## 7. Could the current fee change in the future?
A: There are no plans to change the fee currently. If such a need should arise, this issue will be voted on by the CasperArmy community within the DAO in the future.

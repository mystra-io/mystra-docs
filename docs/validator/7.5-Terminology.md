# 7.5 Terminology

### Era
An era on the Casper is at least 10 blocks, and at least 2 hours in duration.

### Block time
Block time is the measure of the time it takes the validators within a network to verify transactions within one block and produce a new block.

### Address
A staking account address is represented by a truncated hash of a corresponding entity's public key. You can find out what your public key is by connecting through Casper Signer to the Cspr.live website or you can see it directly on the extension.

### Delegation

You can participate in the protocol to earn rewards (additional CSPR). To accomplish this, you can delegate your CSPR tokens to a chosen node operator on the network. The node operator will retain a commission, in the case of CasperArmy it is 4%, which is a percentage of the rewards generated from your staked tokens. The base annual reward rate is currently 8% of the total supply. Delegating your tokens can give you the opportunity to participate in the Casper Network's proof-of-stake consensus system and earn rewards via a validator node. By participating in the protocol this way, you help improve the network's decentralization and security and earn rewards in return.

## What is CasperArmy.org?

CasperArmy is a <a href="https://docs.casperarmy.org/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.2%20DAO">DAO</a> <a href="https://docs.casperarmy.org/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.3%20Venture%20Capital">VC</a>  <a href="https://casper.army">platform</a> for the <a href="https://casper.network">Casper Network</a> community.  The CasperArmy community and all its activities are independent from external entities such as <a href="https://casperlabs.io">CasperLabs</a> and the <a href="https://casper.network/network/blog/meet-the-casper-association">Casper Association</a>. CasperArmy is created by the community for the community and its goal is to incubate, support and accelerate the success of safe projects emerging on the Casper Network, with decision-making participation from the community.

The main assumptions of the creators of CasperArmy are to provide the opportunity to invest at the seed round level of new projects emerging on the Casper Network and to give the community a decision-making voice within the DAO towards their development but also towards the development of the entire CasperArmy organization. Additionally, the task of the CasperArmy platform is to provide tools facilitating and automating the processes of implementing projects into life.

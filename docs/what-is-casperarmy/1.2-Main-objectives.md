## For the Creators

The CasperArmy organisation will help you, as a creator, <a href="https://docs.casperarmy.org/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.4%20Incubation%20HUB">establish partnerships and recruit business angels</a> to fund your start-up. Your first “business angel” will be CasperArmy and its community, which through a <a href="https://docs.casperarmy.org/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.2%20DAO">voting system</a> will help you take direction and develop the idea you present in your pitch deck. CasperArmy will also help you list your project on a launchpad after the <a href="https://docs.casperarmy.org/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.4%20Incubation%20HUB">incubation</a>) period, and the active CasperArmy community will help promote your project in exchange for an airdrop, or early participation in a private pre-sale called seed round as a <a href="https://docs.casperarmy.org/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.3%20Venture%20Capital">Venture Capital</a> entity. As a creator, you are also eligible to apply for an interest-free loan from CasperArmy, which you can repay in your token at the seed round price. The CasperArmy team will decide the loan allocation.

## For the Investors (Community)

The idea behind CasperArmy.org is to create a Layer 2 ecosystem on the Casper Network, free from scams and other attempts to defraud investors. Therefore it is so important for us to be fully transparent about CasperArmy’s activities and the Creators who will offer their start-ups on Casperarmy.org. The CasperArmy <a href="https://docs.casperarmy.org/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.2%20DAO">DAO</a> <a href="https://docs.casperarmy.org/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.3%20Venture%20Capital">VC</a> platform gives the community the opportunity to invest in projects in there early stages of development. This allows investors to purchase project tokens at the lowest price. Access to the platform will be granted only to those who are members of the CasperArmy community on Discord and/or Telegram and have a registered user account on <a href="https://casper.army">CasperArmy platform</a>. CasperArmy’s community member reputation system plays a key role in gaining voting access, therefore, it is important to be regularly active in the community channels. If you are not active for a certain period, you will lose points. When you reach the lower point limit, you will be removed from the voting community, meaning you will no longer be able to use the platform and will no longer be able to take advantage of the benefits that the Casperarmy.org platform will offer.



Removal from the community will not be taken into account for the owners of <a href="https://docs.casperarmy.org/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.8-NFT-CasperArmyNFT">CasperArmy NFT’s</a>, details on https://litepaper.casperarmy.io. Read more about <a href="https://docs.casperarmy.org/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.10-point-system">points system</a>. CasperArmyNFT (<a href="https://docs.casperarmy.org/docs/CasperArmyNFT/6.3-Utilities-by-rank">Elite Club</a>) holders will not be required to stay active in social media activities organised by <a href="https://casperarmy.org">CasperArmy</a>.

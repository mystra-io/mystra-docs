# 3.1 Description

## User Assessment

The point system has been implemented to fairly reward individuals who invest their time, effort, and capital in the development of the Mystra community and its ecosystem. The Mystra platform continually refines this system, enabling the community to make decisions regarding the platform's development and its associated products, while maintaining a full sense of respect, security, and justice.

The point system is comprehensive and designed to provide every user engaged in various areas of Mystra's development with the opportunity to earn points. These areas, referred to as metrics, serve to measure user activity and include:

#### User Commitment

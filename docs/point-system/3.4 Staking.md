# 3.4 Staking

During the update.

## Points for Staking

Governance is fundamental to Mystra. By delegating tokens to the Mystra validator, participants contribute to the Mystra and community, and are the basis for the first step of verifying the trustworthiness of a user account. Please note that to access the resources of the Mystra platform, you must have at least one Premium Pass and have staked a minimum of 5000 CSPR. For more information, check out the <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.7-call-up-ticket">Call-up Ticket</a> and <a href="https://docs.casperarmy.org/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.9-staking">Staking</a>.

### The goals of the staking metric are as follows:

- To encourage staking on the Mystra validator. Check out the <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/validator/7.3-Benefits-of-staking">Benefits of staking</a>
- User Rating rewards long-term delegators over short-term delegators
- Ensure that all new delegators of Mystra feel they have a chance to participate if they make the effort to attend.
- Discourage those who make last moment attempts to participate in staking with large amounts of CSPR to participate in <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.3%20Venture%20Capital">Venture Capital</a> Investments on the <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/PLATFORM/5.3-Available-features">Mystra platform</a>.

# 3.2 User Rating

### User Rating aims to:
- Encourage positive, performance-based participation in the platform
- Encourage forward-looking behavior by investors
- Provide a balanced mechanism that prevents abuse of a single measure to beat the system
- Enable new participants to work towards a good rating and weak and inactive participants to degrade

### Metrics
 
User Rating is a score that includes 7 key metrics to measure positive participation in Mystra. These are described below.
User rating metrics - User Rating (summary and average of metrics 1-7):

1. <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/point-system/3.3-Soldier-Commitment">User Commitment</a> - Community Contribution - points earned from community telegram and/or discord
2. <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/point-system/3.4-Social-Missions-Commitment">Social Missions Commitment</a> - Participation in Mystra social media campaigns (e.g. sweepwidget)
3. <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/point-system/3.5-Staking">Staking</a> - Participation in staking on the CasperArmy validator
4. <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/point-system/3.6-Vote-Quality">Vote Quality</a>
5. <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/point-system/3.7-Venture-Capital">Venture Capital</a> - Participation in Venture Capital of incubated projects
6. <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/point-system/3.8-Tickets">NFT Tickets</a>
7. <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/point-system/3.9-CasperArmyNFT">CasperArmy NFTs</a>

## User Rating
 
### Participants can make positive contributions to the broader ecosystem and should be rewarded accordingly. The objectives of the "User Rating" metric are:

1. To encourage investors to take a long-term view of the Blockchain ecosystem.
2. Mystra rating system rewards those who make positive contributions to other blockchain products, including activities such as staking in other protocols.

## The User Rating metric will perform the following tasks:

### The initial version will track activities related to:

- Staking CSPR on the CasperArmy validator.
- Amount of call-up tickets held.
- User activity on the Mystra social channels - Discord and Telegram.
- User activity for SweepWidget campaigns organized by Mystra.

User Rating is the sum of the above metrics. Each metric will be evenly weighted, but each weight can be changed through Mystra community management. The weighting ensures that no significant manipulation of one metric can occur to gain an advantage over others.

## Penalties

To ensure every participant has an equal opportunity to earn a good User Rating by focusing on the seven metrics above, negative or inactive activity will be penalized and an investor's User Rating will be negatively impacted.

### The objectives of penalizing users for the above are as follows:

- To discourage individuals from withdrawing from Mystra VC investments and abandoning staking.
- Reducing an individual's User Rating, thereby reducing the benefits of a good User Rating.
- Ensuring that the penalty does not discourage people from returning to Mystra, but requires them to improve their User Rating through the same process as for everyone else.
- Discouraging the withdrawal of large amounts of CSPR from staking immediately after completing the token purchase process of an incubated project.

### The unstaking/undelegating penalty will perform the following actions:

Once the unstaking/undelegating transaction is posted, the amount of CSPR that was removed from staking will affect the individual's User Rating, but the impact of the penalty will decrease over time. The penalty will be applied to the staking metric and proportionally to the individual's four User Rating metrics. These four metrics are User Commitment, Social Missions Commitment, Venture Capital and Vote Quality. The penalty does not include the CasperArmyNFT and NFT Ticket metrics.

The incremental penalty reduction period will be 30 days. On the first day, 30/30 of the amount of staking that has been unstaked will result in a reduction of the individual's User Rating. After 30 days, the unstaked penalty will no longer affect the User Rating.

## Fiat Payment Gateway

If you are using a cryptocurrency platform and want to purchase some cryptocurrencies but only have traditional FIAT currencies, then the FIAT payment gateway is a special point that helps you convert your traditional money into these digital cryptocurrencies.

### Here's how it works:
First, you choose what you would like to purchase on the platform, for example, CSPR. Then, during the payment process, you select the FIAT payment option, similar to paying with a credit card online. This redirects you to an external payment service where you provide your credit card details or other information needed to complete the payment.

Once the payment provider confirms your payment, you receive your cryptocurrencies. This FIAT payment gateway plays a crucial role in this process, assisting you in converting your traditional money into digital cryptocurrencies.

On the Mystra platform, you can purchase **CSPR** tokens using currencies such as **EUR**, **USD**, or **PLN**, with a fee of **2%**.

**In the future, Mystra plans to expand the range of available cryptocurrencies for purchase.**

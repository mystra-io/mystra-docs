# 2.8 Premium Pass

## What is a Premium Pass?

The Premium Pass is presented in the form of a unique NFT with a specific identification number and is available in a limited quantity. It is required to access all the capabilities and features of the Mystra platform.

## What function does it serve?

### 1. Premium Pass provides access to tools that allow you to create your own projects within the <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.1%20Creators%20platform">Creators Platform</a>.


### 2. Using the Premium Pass in conjunction with <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.9-staking">staking</a> on the Mystra <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/validator/7.1-Validator-features">validator</a> provides access to modules and benefits such as:

- ### <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.2%20DAO">DAO</a> (Decentralized Autonoumous Organization)

You have a decisive vote in matters related to the development of the Mystra platform and decisions related to the incubation of future projects on the platform.

- ### <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.3%20Venture%20Capital">Decentralized Venture Capital</a>
Taking part in token purchases in the early seed round phase, which functions as a form of Decentralized Venture Capital, allows investors to engage in private sales of cryptocurrency tokens before their official debut on exchanges through Launchpad.

- ### Launchpad
Acquiring tokens in various phases, including during public sales, is carried out in accordance with the principles of the Launchpad platform.

- ### More points in the <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/point-system/3.1-Description">Point System</a>
Each Premium Pass is algorithmically assigned a certain number of points. You can increase your point total by purchasing more Premium Passes. The number of points on the Mystra platform affects the allocation of tokens in the early stages of their acquisition through Decentralized Venture Capital and Launchpad, as well as influencing the strength of your vote in DAO. You can purchase a maximum of 100 Premium Passes per wallet. However, only 10 Premium Passes per wallet will be considered in the token acquisition and DAO voting process. This is aimed at preventing the dominance of large players and promoting more balanced management. To learn more about the point system, visit the link provided above.


## The acquisition of Premium Passes

The Premium Pass value varies depending on the round. It can be acquired directly on the Mystra platform or through the NFT Marketplace, either within the Mystra platform or on other independent markets.

## FAQ about Premium Passes


### Why are Premium Passes sold in rounds?

Premium Passes are sold in rounds due to the discount thresholds that are adopted. The earlier you buy your Premium Pass, the bigger discount you will get.

### Where can I see my purchased Premium Pass?

Once purchased, the Premium Pass will be assigned to your account which will be verifiable on the blockchain. However, you will be able to see all your Premium Passes and other products assigned to your account, points accumulated and NFTs held in the User Panel on the Mystra platform. Read more in the article under the heading “user accounts”

### What is the supply of Premium Passes?

The total number of available Premium Passes in circulation is unlimited. The first five rounds of Premium Pass sales are allocated a set amount distributed at discounted prices. The discount is specified in each round separately. The 6th round will have no max supply now. Round 6 will have a minimum of 1,000 Premium Passes but the final number will be decided by Premium Pass holders from rounds 1-5 in a DAO vote.

### How long will the Premium Pass sales last?

We will have 6 rounds, 1–5 will have a set amount of allocated Premium Passes which can be purchased on FCFS basis. Each round will see a price increase as the rounds progress, rounds are not time limited but will progress on to the subsequent round once the previous rounds allocation has been fulfilled. Round 6 will have a minimum of 1,000 Premium Passes but the final number will be decided by Premium Pass holders from rounds 1-5 in a DAO vote. 

It will be possible to purchase Premium Passes and track sales data on our websites: mystra.io and mystra.app.

Please keep in mind the earlier you gain access to a round, the cheaper your Premium Pass will be, please refer to the earlier price table.

### What if not all Premium Passes are sold in 5 rounds?

Unsold Premium Passes do not affect the launch time of the CasperArmyNFT pre-sale and incubation platform. Premium Pass sales will continue independently until the pool of discounted Premium Passes is exhausted — Round 6 will have a minimum of 1,000 Premium Passes but the final number will be decided by Premium Pass holders from rounds 1-5 in a DAO vote.

### How many Premium Passes can I purchase?

### Can I resell my Premium Pass?

You can resell your Premium Pass on our NFT marketplace at any time.

### On which networks can I purchase a Premium Pass?

Mystra NFT Premium Passes can be purchased by using the following:
See <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.11-networks-and-payments">Networks and Payments</a>.
### Why can a Premium Pass be purchased on other networks?

One of Mystra main goals is to promote Casper to users of other networks. To encourage investors using such networks as BSC, ETH or Polygon the creators of Mystra decided that the sale of Premium Passes guaranteeing access to the Mystra platform and pre-sale of CasperArmyNFT will also take place on other popular networks.

Please note the actual CasperArmyNFT collection will be on the Casper Network, the Premium Pass sale rounds only have the option to be purchased on the previously mentioned networks.

### Why do I need a Premium Pass and additionally stake CSPR?

It is important that reliable and active users of the Mystra community have access to the Mystra platform. The combination of having a Premium Pass and staking is one of several adopted mechanisms to check the credibility of the user and protects the platform from fake accounts and bots, which are often found on many platforms to gain allocations in a fraudulent way. By limiting the access to the platform to dishonest people in this way, we ensure real allocations for real users.

### How does the Premium Pass mechanism work?

The mechanism for allocating points to each Premium Pass is based on the Premium Pass point metric. The Premium Pass points metric is one of the 7 that affect the investor/user rating on the Mystra platform. The data collected from all 7 metrics is applied to your “Soldier Rating”, which determines allocation, ranking — position in the community, voting power, place in the queue, airdrop allocation and airdrop chances, and more.

You can learn more about the point system in the documentation of <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/point-system/3.1-Description">points system</a>. 

- Each Premium Pass has an algorithmically assigned number of points from the maximum point pool assigned to the Premium Pass point metric
- The maximum point pool for all Premium Passes in circulation is 500,000 points
- The maximum point pool in the metric can only decrease or increase as a result of voting by the Mystra community

This means that the number of points assigned to a Premium Pass is dynamic and will change as it decreases with the increase of Premium Passes sold, and/or increase if the community votes on the point pool in the Premium Pass point metric.

### When will the Premium Pass sales start?

Information about the start of Round 1 Premium Pass sales will appear on our official <a href="https://twitter.com/mystraofficial">Twitter</a> and on Mystra social media channels i.e. <a href="https://discord.gg/sZQVdRCyqx">Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/mystraofficial">Telegram</a>.


### Premium Pass Airdrop
From each round, 5% of the Premium Passes are allocated to airdrop. The first airdrop of Premium Passes will take place before the start of the sale of round one. Before the sale of round one, the airdrop can be expected by any user who meets the criteria of the sweepwidget campaign. In each subsequent round, the airdrop will be announced during the Premium Pass sales. Airdrops from round two to round six will be distributed to those who already have Premium Passes. This is to protect airdrops from distribution to fake accounts and to reward real community members.

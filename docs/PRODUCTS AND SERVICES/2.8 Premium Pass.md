### Why are tickets sold in rounds?

Tickets are sold in rounds due to the discount thresholds that are adopted. The earlier you buy your ticket, the bigger discount you will get.

### Where can I see my purchased ticket?

Once purchased, the ticket will be assigned to your account which will be verifiable on the blockchain. However, you will be able to see all your tickets and other products assigned to your account, points accumulated and NFTs held in the User Panel on the Mystra platform. Read more in the article under the heading “user accounts”

### What is the supply of tickets?

The total number of available tickets in circulation is unlimited. The first five rounds of ticket sales are allocated a set amount distributed at discounted prices. The discount is specified in each round separately. The 6th round will have no max supply now. Round 6 will have a minimum of 1,000 tickets but the final number will be decided by ticket holders from rounds 1-5 in a DAO vote.

### How long will the ticket sales last?

We will have 6 rounds, 1–5 will have a set amount of allocated tickets which can be purchased on FCFS basis. Each round will see a price increase as the rounds progress, rounds are not time limited but will progress on to the subsequent round once the previous rounds allocation has been fulfilled. Round 6 will have a minimum of 1,000 tickets but the final number will be decided by ticket holders from rounds 1-5 in a DAO vote. 

It will be possible to purchase tickets and track sales data on our websites: mystra.io and mystra.app.

Please keep in mind the earlier you gain access to a round, the cheaper your ticket will be, please refer to the earlier price table.

### What if not all tickets are sold in 5 rounds?

Unsold tickets do not affect the launch time of the CasperArmyNFT pre-sale and incubation platform. Ticket sales will continue independently until the pool of discounted tickets is exhausted — Round 6 will have a minimum of 1,000 tickets but the final number will be decided by ticket holders from rounds 1-5 in a DAO vote.

### How many tickets can I purchase?

One wallet/address (Casper Signer and/or Metamask) can purchase a maximum of 100 tickets.

### Can I resell my ticket?

Yes, tickets are transferable. Each minted ticket you have is in the form of an NFT,
You can resell your ticket on our NFT marketplace at any time.

### On which networks can I purchase a ticket?

Mystra NFT Tickets can be purchased by using the following:
See <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.11-networks-and-payments">Networks and Payments</a>.
### Why can a ticket be purchased on other networks?

One of Mystra main goals is to promote Casper to users of other networks. To encourage investors using such networks as BSC, ETH or Polygon the creators of Mystra decided that the sale of tickets guaranteeing access to the Mystra platform and pre-sale of CasperArmyNFT will also take place on other popular networks.

Please note the actual CasperArmyNFT collection will be on the Casper Network, the ticket sale rounds only have the option to be purchased on the previously mentioned networks.

### Why do I need a ticket and additionally stake CSPR?

It is important that reliable and active users of the Mystra community have access to the Mystra platform. The combination of having a ticket and staking is one of several adopted mechanisms to check the credibility of the user and protects the platform from fake accounts and bots, which are often found on many platforms to gain allocations in a fraudulent way. By limiting the access to the platform to dishonest people in this way, we ensure real allocations for real users.

### How does the ticket mechanism work?

The mechanism for allocating points to each ticket is based on the ticket point metric. The ticket points metric is one of the 7 that affect the investor/user rating on the Mystra platform. The data collected from all 7 metrics is applied to your “Soldier Rating”, which determines allocation, ranking — position in the community, voting power, place in the queue, airdrop allocation and airdrop chances, and more.

You can learn more about the point system in the documentation of <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/point-system/3.1-Description">points system</a>. 

- Each ticket has an algorithmically assigned number of points from the maximum point pool assigned to the ticket point metric
- The maximum point pool for all tickets in circulation is 500,000 points
- The maximum point pool in the metric can only decrease or increase as a result of voting by the Mystra community

This means that the number of points assigned to a ticket is dynamic and will change as it decreases with the increase of tickets sold, and/or increase if the community votes on the point pool in the ticket point metric.

### When will the ticket sales start?

Information about the start of Round 1 ticket sales will appear on our official <a href="https://twitter.com/mystraofficial">Twitter</a> and on Mystra social media channels i.e. <a href="https://discord.gg/sZQVdRCyqx">Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/mystraofficial">Telegram</a>.

### Tickets Airdrop
From each round, 5% of the tickets are allocated to airdrop. The first airdrop of tickets will take place before the start of the sale of round one. Before the sale of round one, the airdrop can be expected by any user who meets the criteria of the sweepwidget campaign. In each subsequent round, the airdrop will be announced during the ticket sales. Airdrops from round two to round six will be distributed to those who already have Call-up Tickets. This is to protect airdrops from distribution to fake accounts and to reward real community members.

# 2.8 Premium Pass

## What is a Premium Pass?

The Premium Pass is presented in the form of a unique NFT with a specific identification number and is available in a limited quantity. It is required to access all the capabilities and features of the Mystra platform.

### What function does it serve?

#### 1. Premium Pass provides access to tools that allow you to create your own projects within the <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.1%20Creators%20platform">Creators Platform</a>.


#### 2. Using the Premium Pass in conjunction with <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.9-staking">staking</a> on the Mystra <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/validator/7.1-Validator-features">validator</a> provides access to modules and benefits such as:

- #### <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.2%20DAO">DAO</a> (Decentralized Autonoumous Organization)

You have a decisive vote in matters related to the development of the Mystra platform and decisions related to the incubation of future projects on the platform.

- #### <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/PRODUCTS%20AND%20SERVICES/2.3%20Venture%20Capital">Decentralized Venture Capital</a>
Participating in token acquisitions during the early seed round phase, functioning as a form of Decentralized Venture Capital, enables the community to privately commit to cryptocurrency tokens before their official debut on exchanges through the Launchpad.

- #### Launchpad
Acquiring tokens in various phases, including during public sales, is carried out in accordance with the principles of the Launchpad platform.

- #### More points in the <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/point-system/3.1-Description">Point System</a>
Each Premium Pass is algorithmically assigned a specific number of points according to the <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/point-system/3.1-Description">Point System</a>. The Premium Pass point metric is one of the 7 metrics influencing the User Rating. You can increase your total points by purchasing more Premium Passes. The number of points on the Mystra platform affects the allocation of tokens in the early stages of their acquisition through Decentralized Venture Capital and Launchpad, as well as influencing the strength of your vote in DAO. You can acquire a maximum of 100 Premium Passes per wallet. However, only 10 Premium Passes per wallet will be considered in the token acquisition and DAO voting process. This is aimed at preventing the dominance of large players and promoting more balanced management. To learn more about the point system, visit the link provided above.


## The acquisition of Premium Passes

The Premium Pass value varies depending on the round. It can be acquired directly on the Mystra platform or through the NFT Marketplace, either within the Mystra platform or on other independent markets.

#### What is the supply of Premium Passes?

- The total number of available Premium Passes in circulation is 43,900. The number of available Premium Passes is distributed across rounds, and their value depends on them.

#### Why do I need a Premium Pass and additionally stake CSPR?

- It is important that reliable and active users of the Mystra community have access to the Mystra platform. The combination of having a Premium Pass and staking is one of several adopted mechanisms to check the credibility of the user and protects the platform from fake accounts and bots, which are often found on many platforms to gain allocations in a fraudulent way. By limiting the access to the platform to dishonest people in this way, we ensure real allocations for real users. Currently, it is possible to stake CSPR tokens on our validator. In the future, Mystra validation nodes will also be available on other networks.

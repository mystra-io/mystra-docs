# Chat

In the Web3 chat, you can communicate with other users, but it's not an ordinary chat. It's a special platform associated with Web3 technology, where you have the opportunity for direct contact with owners of other wallets and the exchange of information.

The Web3 chat can also be integrated with your cryptocurrency wallet. This allows you to track your balance, send or receive cryptocurrencies, and monitor current exchange rates without leaving the chat. It's like having all the tools related to cryptocurrencies in one place.

The Web3 chat often relies on blockchain technology, meaning that transactions and messages are recorded in a permanent and secure manner. No one can delete or alter them, providing greater certainty that everything is fair and reliable.

The chat on the Mystra platform allows you to create your own thematic groups with other users so that you can exchange information related to the group's topic.

A Bridge refers to a platform or protocol that enables the transfer of digital assets between different blockchains or networks. The bridge serves as a connection between two separate blockchain ecosystems, allowing the movement of tokens or other digital assets between them.

The main features of bridges include:

Interoperability: Bridges are created to facilitate interoperability between different blockchains. They enable the transmission and reception of assets between different networks that may be based on various standards and protocols.

Token Bridging: Some bridges use special tokens (often called "wrapped" or "pegged" tokens) that represent the equivalent of assets on another blockchain. These tokens are created and destroyed depending on the flow of assets.

Bidirectional Bridges: In some cases, bridges can be bidirectional, allowing users to move between different blockchains in both the "to" and "from" directions.

How does a bridge work?

Imagine a situation where you own an NFT stored on blockchain A, but you want to use it in a game or application installed on blockchain B. This task becomes a challenge due to the independence of the operation of both blockchains, which cannot communicate directly.

The procedure looks like this: Your NFT is "frozen" on blockchain A, meaning it is temporarily locked. Then, you receive a special equivalent of that NFT on blockchain B. It is practically the same NFT but operates on a different platform. At any time, you can "unlock" your NFT on blockchain A and use it again where it was originally stored.

In this situation, the need for a cryptocurrency "bridge" arises.

This "bridge" serves as a technological connection between blockchain A and blockchain B. Thanks to this connectivity, you have the ability to transfer your NFT from blockchain A to blockchain B, enabling its use in the chosen location.

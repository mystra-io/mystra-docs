## OTC Market

Mystra platform plans to launch OTC Market in the future.

## How does it work?

**OTC (Over-The-Counter) Market** is a place where individuals and institutions can conduct large cryptocurrency buying and selling transactions without using a public exchange. It's like a personal agreement between you and another person or company, instead of using a public exchange.

In the OTC Market, there are no public orders or visible offers like on an exchange. Instead, investors or traders negotiate the price and quantity directly with each other or through specialized intermediary firms. This can be useful when you want to make a large transaction without influencing the price on the exchange.

However, the OTC Market is typically available only to large players because it requires trust and negotiation skills. It's not as accessible to the average investor as a public cryptocurrency exchange, which is more transparent and open to everyone.

### Some mechanisms used by the OTC market:

- **Direct Trading:** Peer-to-Peer Transactions: Participants in the OTC market engage in direct transactions with each other. This allows for more flexibility and customization of trade terms.

- **Pricing Information:** OTC markets often rely on quotation systems to provide pricing information. Participants can see quotes for various assets, helping them make informed trading decisions.

- **Networks of Dealers:** OTC markets consist of networks of dealers who facilitate trades. These dealers may specialize in specific assets or markets, contributing to the overall efficiency of the OTC market.

- **Wide Range of Instruments:** The OTC market encompasses a broad range of asset classes, including stocks, bonds, derivatives, and cryptocurrencies. Participants can find opportunities to trade various instruments.

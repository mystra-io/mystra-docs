# DEX

"DEX" is an abbreviation for "Decentralized Exchange," enabling users to exchange cryptocurrencies without relying on intermediaries, such as traditional Centralized Exchanges (CEX). DEX operates on a decentralized infrastructure based on blockchain technology, meaning there is no single central point of control.

## Key functionalities of DEX on the Mystra platform:

**SWAP (Decentralized Exchange)**

Swap is a decentralized exchange of one cryptocurrency for another. Swaps are executed through smart contracts that automatically complete transactions when specific conditions are met. Swapping on DEX is typically simpler and more direct than on traditional exchanges, as it doesn't require depositing funds on the exchange and usually involves lower transaction fees.

Liquidity Pools:

Users who wish to provide liquidity for a specific token on DEX deposit their assets into liquidity pools.

- **Token Pairing:** Liquidity pools usually involve two correlated tokens, such as ETH and another ERC-20 token. This enables the exchange between these tokens on the DEX platform.

Earning from Fees:

Individuals providing liquidity receive LP Tokens (Liquidity Provider Tokens) in return, representing their share in the pool. They can also earn transaction fees charged by the DEX platform for using the liquidity pool.


Automatic Allocation of Liquidity:

Liquidity pools operate automatically through smart contracts, which establish asset prices in the pool based on the ratio of available tokens.

Reducing Spread:

By providing liquidity, liquidity pools decrease the spread (difference between buying and selling prices), making transactions more efficient.

- ### Impermanent Loss Risk:
**Users must be aware of the risk called "impermanent loss," indicating that the value of their assets in the pool may change based on fluctuations in token prices.**

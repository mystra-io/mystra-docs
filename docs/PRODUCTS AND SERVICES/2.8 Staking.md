# 2.8 Staking

## Mystra Staking

### Nodes:
- On Casper Network (CasperArmy Node Validator for staking on Casper Network) <a href="https://cspr.live/validator/020377bc3ad54b5505971e001044ea822a3f6f307f8dc93fa45a05b7463c0a053bed">Redirect to node</a>
- On Ethereum Network (in progress...)
- On Polygon Network (in progress...)

### Important
The staked coins are never physically transferred to the validator. Control of the coins always belongs to the delegator (to you). Even if the validator becomes inactive, you will still be able to undelegate your CSPR. <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/validator/7.1-Validator-features">Read More...</a>

# 6.4 NFT Purchase queue

## There are two types of queues in the operation of Mystra:

Your place in the queue to purchase CasperArmyNFT will be determined by your User Rating, which will be assigned to your User Account on our platform. The <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/point-system/3.1-Description/">User Rating</a> is determined by the total amount of points you have accumulated in all areas where you can earn points. The more points you have the higher the User Rating, the higher the priority of your place in the CasperArmyNFT purchase queue and the higher your chances of purchasing. Check out more under: <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/point-system/3.1-Description/">Point system</a>.
After buying CasperArmyNFT you will be assigned points corresponding to the rank of the NFT you bought, which will count towards your <a href="https://docs.mystra.io/docs/point-system/3.1-Description/">User Rating</a>.

### Purchase queue:
- Users with the highest number of points will be qualified to the NFT purchase queue as BUY NOW.
- All other users will be eligible to participate in the BIDDING AUCTION.
